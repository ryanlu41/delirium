The code in this folder was used to generate the features used to build the predictive model. Not all features were used in the final model.

Each folder of code generates csvs with patientunitstayids attached, which were later concatenated and pre-processed before being used for training. 

More specific instructions on generating features are in the READMEs of each folder.
